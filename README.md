This app lives only in GitHub (not in Google Play Store) because I am not willing to pay (at least not now) Google 25 bucks
just for hosting free, open-source program. Maybe, if I loved Android OS... but I don't.

To the point -- this app sports tiny system settings that I think they should be in stock Android (thus "missing"), namely:

##  Selective rotation 

I.e. disable rotation on lock, when the phone is locked, and the screen goes on (on call, on wake up alarm) 
rotation is disabled, this will help you get your phone from the pocket and hit the right button
once the phone is unlocked, the auto-rotation is enabled
                              
## Proximity lock 

I.e. don't turn screen on in your pocket -- stock Android will turn the screen on when you hit home or 
power button no matter if you are holding the phone, or if phone is in your pocket
this feature uses proximity sensor to keep the screen off if the phone is in your pocket 
(yes, I know, there is some 1 nanosecond screen flicker)
                    
Use case: you have phone in your pocket, you receive the call, you grab your phone and... the screen is 
turned off and the phone is still ringing. Don't panic, just press the home or power button as you did, 
to turn the screen on.
                    
Granted, this feature requires some getting used to it, but after a while it nicely pays off.
                    
                    
## UNINSTALLING

You don't like the app? It happens :-) Use "uninstall" button within the app, not uninstall feature in the system.


## LICENSE

Be fair and use common-sense, which translates, if you would like to grab entire code and publish it on Google Play Store, 
or use it in your own app, do it, as long you put appropriate credits (containing my full name) in a place available for non-dev 
user (for Google Play Store it should be Play Store app web page).

That's all, have fun!
